This Project aims to Analyze Covid19 Data using Python, To Understand the global impact of the pandemic.Focusing on data cleaning,visualization and statistical insights.
The analysis helps in understanding the spread of Covid19 Confirmed cases, Deaths and Recoveries the impact on different countries and trends over time.

Objectives
* Load and preprocess Covid19 data.
* Perform Explotary data analysis(EDA).
* Explore the growth of Covid19 cases overtime.
* Visualize trends of confirmed cases,deaths and recoveries.
* Identify the most affected countries.
* Analyze the death rate over time.

Toos and Technologies :
* Jupyter Notebook- for interactive coding.
* Pandas - for data manipulation and prepocessing.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn - for data visualization.
  
How to Run the Project
Clone this repository:
Copy Edit git clone https://github.com/ChandanaB06/Covid_19_data_analysis-EDA 
Install dependencies
Run the Jupyter Notebook: Copy Edit jupyter notebook Explore the visualizations and results. Results Key findings are visualized through bar charts, heatmaps, and pie charts.

Key Findings and Future scope :
1. Growth Over Time.
2. To affected countries.
3. Recovery and death rates.
4. Covid19 cases increases significantly overtime.
5. Some countries were more affected than others.
6. Country-wise analysis and continent-wise deeper analysis.
7. Machine learning models for Covid19 trend prediction.

This project provides valuable insights into Covid19 trends and highlights the importance of Data analysis in healthcare decision-making.
It demonstrates how python tools can be used for data-driven insights and visualization.

Data collection: Import Covid19 data from a CSV file.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values,convert data formats and filter required columns.
